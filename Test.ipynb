    "You and your friend are playing your old Snakes and Ladders board game. Each player begins on square 1 and takes turns rolling a fair 6-sided die. The player moves the number of spaces indicated on the die. If you land at the bottom of a ladder, you automatically move to the square at the top of the ladder. Conversely, if you land on a snake head, then you fall to the square at the snake's tail. The winner is the first person to make it onto or past the last square.\n",
