    "You and your friend are playing your old Snakes and Ladders board game. Each player begins on square 1 and takes turns rolling a fair 6-sided die. The player moves the number of spaces indicated on the die. If you land at the bottom of a ladder, you automatically move to the square at the top of the ladder. Conversely, if you land on a snake head, then you fall to the square at the snake's tail. The winner is the first person to make it onto or past the last square.\n",

    "Please answer the following questions using any means available. We would like you to keep a record of your work and walk us through your solution. We are primarily interested in your approach and code, rather than the final answers."
